## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository is a playground to apply NLP techniques on twitter threads.

Currently there exists a class that gets the last 200 tweets from any twitter handle and writes it to a json file (for future frontend consumption).

To use this repo.

Rename the `cred_sample.py` to `creds.py` and fill out the neccessary information.
You can set up the keys and tokens from: `http://apps.twitter.com` (assuming you have a twitter account)

The python notebook shows an example of how to get the tweets for a user.

### TO DO
* Apply NLP techniques using Spacy, Gensim and scikit learn to tweets
* Generate comprehensive twitter analysis via these methods.
* Example: Use NLP techniques to predict whether a given trump tweet is written by himself or his PR team.
